High CXPacket Wait counts in an OLTP environment can be used as an indication towards performance issues relating 
to Query Parallelism in your environment due to having multiple cores available. As part of you investigation into 
determining if you need to adjust your MAXDOP (Max Degree of Parallelism) 
this script allows you to capture the various wait counts over time with changing the value of you MAXDOP setting.
